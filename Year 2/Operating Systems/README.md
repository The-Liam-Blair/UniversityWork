# Operating Systems

Worked with a group to design and develop a program intended to be run on a Linux OS. The program is a simplified, user - friendly
version of the crontab command, which allows the user to set a daemon that will run a command on a set time repeatedly.
Includes all the functionality of the crontab command, but presented with a TUI to make it easier to use.

Completed as a group with members: Liam Blair, Murray Hastie, Mikha Röhrs.
