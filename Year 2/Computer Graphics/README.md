# Computer Graphics

Courseworks 1 and 2 ongoing. Will be developed with C++ using OpenGL.


Coursework 1 is to design a 3D environment utilising a variety of features, such as multiple moving cameras, multiple objects with
a variety of meshes, introduce multiple lights and incorporate good shaders for all the objects. Also include functionality
to have the objects move.

Coursework 2 expands on coursework 1, requiring shadowing as well as implementing any graphical feature not covered in the general
lectures.
