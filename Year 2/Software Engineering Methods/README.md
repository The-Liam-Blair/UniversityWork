# Software Engineering Methods

Ongoing coursework with Peter Verner working to create a complex project in Java and utilising multiple other systems
to provide continuous integration, delivery, as well as incorporating automated tests and kanban boards. Docker is used as
the deployment platform, Travis CI is the continuous integration build test, and Zube.io is being used for kanban
boards. Project is being developed using the Scrum agile development method.

The coursework is currently not finished, but it can be viewed at https://github.com/petertheverner/semethods.
