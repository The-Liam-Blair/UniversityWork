# Programming Fundamentals

Short coursework written in c. Designed to be run with the Microsoft C Compiler. Takes in an input .txt file, a character string to search
for, and (optionally) a character string to replace the search for. Without selecting a replacement string, it will search for all instances
of the word string and output it's index (of the starting character) every time the string is encountered. If a replacement string
is selected, it will also change the original character string to the string input by the user.
